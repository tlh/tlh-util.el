# tlh-util.el

This is a collection of elisp utility functions and macros I've found
useful at some point.  I've written most myself, but some are
cannibalized from elsewhere.  I originally tried giving credit where
due, but found that most of the time the person I got it from had
themselves gotten it from someone else, and on backward into the mist.
So I've done away with credit, and therefore take credit for none of
it.  Keeps things cleaner, too.

None of these utilities are namespace-prefixed, so watch out for
stomping.
